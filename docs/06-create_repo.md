# Create a repository

Now that we have some people (users) and a team, we should create a repository so that we can assign them ownership to it. When setting up your organization, you might create repositories _before_ adding users or creating teams and that is absolutely ok.

## Add a repo

1. From your organization homepage, click **New**.
1. Enter a repository name in the **Repository name** field. For this training, enter `example-repo`.
1. Provide a description for your repository. For this training, enter `An example repository for a training`.
1. In the repository visibility section, select **Private**.
1. Select the **Add a README file** in the **Initialize this repository with:** section.
