# Getting Started with GitHub Organizations
## What are GitHub Organizations?

An organization is a collection of repositories that are typically maintained by an individual or business.  These repositories can be open source or private based on the goals of the organization.  An additional benefit of GitHub Organizations is the ability to manage individual users with **Teams**.  **Teams** act as a way to group similar contributors by access permissions or job responsibilities. **Teams** also allow an organization to communicate more effectively with a group working on a specific project.

## Lets put this into action:

Meet Stephen.

Stephen runs a business where he sells blinker fluid online.

As his business gained traction and popularity, Stephen had to expand. 

He needed more control over his repositories and who accesses them.

In comes GitHub Organizations.

With GitHub Organizations, Stephen can:
- [x] Manage all of his repositories from one place
- [x] Organize individual staff into teams
- [x] Provide respository access and privileges to the correct team
