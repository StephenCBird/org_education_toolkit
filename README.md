Hello GitHub! :wave:

During my first initial experiences with GitHub, I found myself flooded with information and found it difficult to identify an easy way to keep repositories organized.  While exploring for a solution, I stumbled onto GitHub Organizations.  This seemed like exactly what I needed.  My only issue... how do even get started?

This education was born out of me wanting to learn more about organizations and managing them on GitHub.
