GitHub is an amazing hosting platform for software development and hosts more than 190 million repositories for more than 60 million users <sup> [1](https://github.com/search?q=&ref=simplesearch) </sup>. Whether a company like Microsoft™ <sup> [2](https://github.com/microsoft) </sup> or an enthusiast trying to learn python for fun <sup> [3](https://lab.github.com/everydeveloper/introduction-to-python) </sup>, there is something for everyone.  
An exciting feature which can help you take your next step with GitHub is Organizations.  Organizations allow you better tackle managing a project and help you create a better workflow for teams. Teams allow individuals within an organization to better communicate together and work towards a common goal.
