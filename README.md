Hello GitHub! :wave:

I created this training module based on my previous experience moving from a user account with repositories to GitHub Organizations. There is an assortment of great material out there on general GitHub use (like [this help document about organizations](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/setting-up-and-managing-organizations-and-teams/about-organizations) or [this introduction to Git and GitHub](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=47E-jcuQz5c&list=PLg7s6cbtAD17Gw5u8644bgKhgRLiJXdX4)), and even a specific video on [teams and organizations](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpRQ3uucPaM), if you are interested.

This education was born out of me wanting to learn more about the "why" of creating organizations and managing them on GitHub. 

- Why should I use an organization?
- What benefits do I get over a personal account?
- Why do I enable specific settings?
- Do I need a team?
